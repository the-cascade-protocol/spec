# Cascade Workbench Vocabulary — Changelog

All notable changes to the `workbench:` vocabulary. Draft status: not registered in `spec/VOCAB_VERSIONS` until v1.0 graduation (per the `genomics:` / `advisory:` draft policy).

## v1-draft.0.5 (2026-07-15)

- **Added the notes / research-flags / follow-ups substrate as W3C Web Annotations** ([NOTES-ANNOTATION-VOCAB]; proposal `cascade-workbench/docs/planning/vocab-proposals/2026-07-13-notes-as-web-annotations.md`). All three artifacts are ONE thing, an `oa:Annotation` over one or more graph nodes, distinguished by `oa:motivatedBy`: caregiver note = `oa:commenting`, research flag = `oa:questioning`, follow-up = `workbench:followUp`.
- **Layer-1 reuse, nothing redeclared:** `oa:` carries body (`oa:TextualBody`), multi-target (`oa:hasTarget`), motivation, and span selectors (`oa:TextQuoteSelector` / `oa:TextPositionSelector` via `oa:SpecificResource`); PROV-O carries required attribution (`prov:wasAttributedTo`, `prov:generatedAtTime`). Follow-ups are dual-typed `cal:Vtodo` and reuse W3C RDF Calendar `ical:due` (optional) + `ical:status` (required, RFC 5545 VTODO enum). `schema:dueDate` was considered and rejected: it does not exist (verified 404; schema.org defines only `paymentDueDate`).
- **Minted exactly one term:** `workbench:followUp`, an `oa:Motivation` with `skos:broader oa:questioning`, per the Web Annotation model's custom-motivation extension rule.
- **Removed** `workbench:InvestigationNote`, `workbench:hasNote`, `workbench:noteText` (draft removal; never emitted by shipping code). An investigation-scoped note is an `oa:Annotation` targeting the `workbench:Investigation`.
- **SHACL (Core only, validator-enforced):** `WebAnnotationShape` (>= 1 target, >= 1 motivation, required attribution + `xsd:dateTime` timestamp), `CommentingBodyShape` (commenting requires a body), `FollowUpShape` (followUp requires `ical:status` in the VTODO enum). Verified against `cascade validate` with positive + negative fixtures (all three violation classes fire; valid multi-target, selector-anchored, and Vtodo notes pass).
- **Pod placement:** notes live in a top-level `notes/` container (`pod-structure.md` §5.2), separate from `annotations/` (record-amendment overlays are edit machinery, not user content).

## v1-draft.0.4 (2026-06-28)

- **Added the filing / organization axis:** `workbench:userSourceLabel` (xsd:string), the user-chosen label for the SOURCE a record is filed under in the Workbench "filing cabinet".
- It is a filing **preference attributed to the user**, carried on a `workbench:Annotation` overlay (`annotationProperty` = `"workbench:userSourceLabel"`, `annotationValue` = the chosen label) whose overlay bears `cascade:SelfReported` provenance.
- It **must not** overwrite the objective imported origin `clinical:sourceEHR`, which is preserved and displayed alongside. The effective source the UI groups by prefers this label when present, else falls back to `clinical:sourceEHR`, else the import-batch tag.
- Orthogonal axis with an **open domain**, mirroring how `workbench:verificationStatus` was added in v1-draft.0.3, so it can file any record.
- **SHACL:** no new shape required — the "file under source" action reuses the already-shaped string predicates `workbench:annotationProperty` / `workbench:annotationValue` on `workbench:Annotation`.

## v1-draft.0.1 (2026-06-16)

- Initial draft authored in `spec/` for the Cascade Workbench desktop investigation app (Layer 3).
- **Classes:** `Investigation`, `ImportedConversation`, `Hypothesis`, `Pin`, `InvestigationNote`, plus status enums.
- **Investigation status enum:** `Active`, `Paused`, `Resolved`, `Archived`.
- **Hypothesis status enum:** `Proposed`, `Supported`, `Retired`, `Excluded` (supports widening + explicitly retiring/excluding hypotheses).
- Properties linking investigations to conversations, hypotheses, pins, and notes; conversation metadata; assertion links into `evidence:`.
- **SHACL:** `InvestigationShape`, `ImportedConversationShape`.
- Deliberately thin: grounding model lives in Layer-2 `evidence:`; phenotype lives in `genomics:`.
- Rationale and design review: `cascade-assets/Cascade-documents/Cascade-Workbench/vocab-proposals/`.
