# Core Vocabulary Changelog

## v3.9 - 2026-09-08

The pod owner's name gets a declared home. No new term.

- **No class and no property is added.** The name of the person a Pod belongs
  to lives on `<#me>` in `/profile/extended.ttl` as `foaf:givenName`,
  `foaf:familyName` and `foaf:name`. FOAF already defines all three, so a
  `cascade:` spelling would give one fact two predicates for no gain.
- **The gap.** [IPS `Patient.name`](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/StructureDefinition-Patient-uv-ips.html)
  is `1..*` with the SHALL:populate obligation, and invariant `ips-pat-1`
  requires at least one of `family`, `given` or `text`. Nothing in this
  repository declared a name for the pod owner, so an export had nowhere to read
  one from.
- **Why the extended profile.** `pod-structure.md` section 3.2 makes
  `/profile/card.ttl` the publicly-readable profile document and forbids PHI in
  it; a real name is PHI. Section 3.6 is where PHI about the WebID subject
  already lives, which is the Solid extended-profile convention.
  `/profile/extended.ttl` is inside the encrypted Pod exactly like every other
  Pod file. `foaf:name` in `card.ttl` is unchanged and remains a generic display
  name shown before the Pod is unlocked.
- The "Patient Profile" comment block in `core.ttl`, which had said the name
  lived in `card.ttl`, is corrected. Nothing is renamed, removed or deprecated.
- SHACL (core.shapes.ttl v1.8): `cascade:ExtendedProfileShape`,
  `sh:targetSubjectsOf cascade:dateOfBirth` because an extended profile carries
  no `rdf:type` of its own. Three property shapes, each `xsd:string`,
  `sh:maxCount 1`, `sh:minLength 1`, at `sh:Warning` per the core v3.5 ratchet.
  `foaf:givenName` is capped at one deliberately; a second given name goes in
  `foaf:name`. Export mapping: `family` from `foaf:familyName`, `given` from
  `foaf:givenName`, `text` from `foaf:name`.
- Compatibility: strictly widening. The shape evaluates only nodes that already
  carry `cascade:dateOfBirth` and every constraint on it is optional with a
  `maxCount`, so nothing that validated under v3.8 stops validating.
  `cascade:PatientProfile` nodes in `/profile/health.ttl` carry
  `cascade:dateOfBirth` too and are therefore also reached; they pass unchanged.
- JSON-LD: `givenName`, `familyName` and `name` added to
  `contexts/v1/core.jsonld`, mapped to the FOAF IRIs with `"@type": "xsd:string"`.

## v3.7 - 2026-08-27

A Pod gets somewhere to keep the documents its records point at.

- Added `cascade:Attachment` (`owl:Class`, `rdfs:subClassOf prov:Entity`) and
  seven properties: `cascade:hasAttachment` (`owl:ObjectProperty`, range
  `cascade:Attachment`, domain deliberately absent), `cascade:attachmentPath`,
  `cascade:attachmentMediaType`, `cascade:contentHash`,
  `cascade:hashAlgorithm`, `cascade:byteSize`, `cascade:attachmentTitle`. The
  class mirrors the FHIR R4 `Attachment` datatype and every property cites the
  element it mirrors by canonical URL.
- **The bytes are a file, not a literal.** FHIR permits either, via
  `Attachment.data` (inline base64) or `Attachment.url`. A Pod is not a message:
  its Turtle files are parse-critical, read in full by every consumer to answer
  any question, so an unbounded base64 literal is paid for by readers that will
  never open the attachment. The Turtle carries a small metadata node; the bytes
  live under `attachments/{algorithm}/{digest}`, normative in `pod-structure.md`
  section 4.3. The retained `sources/` directory already establishes that a Pod
  can hold non-Turtle content.
- **The file name is the digest.** Content addressing here is not a storage
  optimisation, it is what makes the metadata checkable: a consumer hashes what
  it read and compares it with where it read it from, so nothing has to be
  trusted to keep name and content in agreement. Cross-source deduplication and
  idempotent re-import follow from that with no mechanism behind them. The name
  carries the digest and nothing else — an extension or a media type in the name
  would be a second, unverified claim about the same bytes.
- **The hash algorithm is named, and is not FHIR's.** `Attachment.hash` fixes
  SHA-1 and base64 in the specification and neither is followed. SHA-1 is
  collision-broken, and a collision in a content-addressed store is a mechanism
  for one document to silently replace another. `cascade:hashAlgorithm` carries
  an explicit [RFC 6920](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6920) registry token,
  and `sha-256` is required of new implementations. The digest is lowercase hex
  rather than base64 because it is also a filename: base64's alphabet contains
  `/` and is case-sensitive.
- **Implementation-defined this release, deliberately:** encryption at rest for
  attachment files, and how the directory participates in Pod sync. Both are
  real and both are deferred rather than forgotten. An implementation may
  encrypt these files by whatever means it already encrypts a Pod; this
  vocabulary states nothing about it, so nothing here is revised when a ratified
  answer arrives.
- SHACL (core.shapes.ttl v1.7): `cascade:AttachmentShape` requires path, digest
  and algorithm at `sh:Violation` — the three facts without which the node
  cannot do its job, and the third is what makes the second checkable rather
  than decorative. The path pattern is stated positively, as `/`-separated
  segments beginning with an alphanumeric, which excludes absolute paths, URLs
  and `..` segments by construction; it is not written as an exclusion because
  SHACL evaluates `sh:pattern` with XPath `fn:matches`, whose XSD 1.1 regular
  expressions have no lookahead. `cascade:AttachmentMediaTypeShape` warns on a
  missing media type; `cascade:HasAttachmentEdgeShape` is open-world
  (`sh:targetSubjectsOf`, `sh:Warning`, no `minCount`, no `sh:class`).
- Compatibility: purely additive. Both node shapes evaluate only
  `cascade:Attachment` nodes, a class no pod written before v3.7 contains, so
  every existing pod validates exactly as it did. Nothing removed, renamed or
  deprecated.
- JSON-LD: eight terms added to `contexts/v1/core.jsonld` and
  `contexts/v1/cascade.jsonld`.

## v3.6 - 2026-08-14

Data absence gets a ratified reason, and a content-derived identifier gets a
canonical form for the fields that became repeatable.

- Added `cascade:dataAbsentReason` (`owl:DatatypeProperty`, domain `owl:Thing`,
  range `xsd:string`): why a record's primary VALUE is absent. Semantics are
  exactly FHIR R4 `Observation.dataAbsentReason`, bound to the 15 codes of
  `http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/data-absent-reason`. The
  nullFlavor-to-data-absent-reason mapping a C-CDA importer must implement is
  stated on the property, so `UNK`, `NAV`, `NASK` and `ASKU` stop arriving as
  one indistinguishable blank. Binding to data-absent-reason rather than to
  `v3-NullFlavor` is deliberate: this vocabulary already cites it, its codes are
  all selectable where `v3-NullFlavor` marks `NI`/`UNK`/`OTH`/`INV` abstract, and
  FHIR is what both converter paths read.
- Stated the CANONICAL FORM of a multi-valued identity input on
  `cascade:cascadeUri`. No term is added by it: the statement constrains
  implementations, not data. Dedupe, sort by Unicode code point, join with a
  fixed separator (U+002C recommended and required of new implementations), and
  a one-element sequence canonicalizes to the bare scalar. Three invariants are
  normative independently of the separator — order independence, scalar
  agreement, duplicate independence — which is what lets an implementation
  already shipping a different separator comply without re-minting. Scope is
  restricted to inputs that are SETS and must never be widened to an input whose
  source order carries meaning.
- SHACL: `cascade:DataAbsentReasonShape` (core.shapes.ttl v1.6), an open-world
  `sh:targetSubjectsOf` shape. It constrains the VALUE wherever the property
  appears and never requires its presence, so every pod written before v3.6
  validates unchanged. Raw NullFlavor codes are deliberately not accepted: an
  importer maps them on the way in, and accepting both spellings would give
  every absence two encodings.
- JSON-LD: `dataAbsentReason` added to `contexts/v1/core.jsonld` and
  `contexts/v1/cascade.jsonld`.
- No class or property removed, renamed or deprecated.
- Downstream sync (cascadeprotocol.org, conformance, cascade-cli,
  sdk-typescript) in the same train; sdk-python and cascade-agent pending per
  the Vocabulary Change Checklist.

## v3.5 - 2026-08-09

The ORIGIN axis: a declared source identity that is canonical across transports.

- Added `cascade:sourceIdentity` (`owl:DatatypeProperty`, domain `owl:Thing`,
  range `xsd:string`): the canonical, transport-independent identity of the
  organization a record came from. Scheme-prefixed so a reader can tell how much
  the producer knew: `org:{slug}`, `ns:{namespace}` (FHIR server base URL or
  C-CDA `<id>` root OID), `transport:{label}` as an honestly-labelled last resort
  that is not an origin claim. The slug normalization both transports must
  implement is stated on the property in `core.ttl`.
- Documented the three source axes in `core.ttl` and narrowed
  `cascade:sourceSystem`'s comment to say what it is NOT: it is the INGESTION
  batch, records how and when data arrived rather than where it came from, and
  must not be used as a reconciliation key. `clinical:sourceEHR` remains the
  display LABEL with unchanged semantics.
- SHACL: `cascade:SourceIdentityShape` (core.shapes.ttl v1.5), an open-world
  `sh:targetSubjectsOf` shape. It constrains the VALUE wherever the property
  appears (single, string, one of the three schemes) and never requires its
  presence, so every pod written before v3.5 validates unchanged. Ratchet path
  to Warning and then Violation is written into the v3.5 changelog in
  `core.ttl`.
- JSON-LD: `sourceIdentity` and `sourceSystem` added to `contexts/v1/core.jsonld`
  and `contexts/v1/cascade.jsonld`.
- No class or property removed, renamed or deprecated.
- Downstream sync (cascadeprotocol.org, conformance, cascade-cli) in the same
  train; sdk-typescript, sdk-python and cascade-agent pending per the Vocabulary
  Change Checklist.

## v3.3 - 2026-06-16

Cascade Workbench support: ungrounded-AI provenance + caregiver-proxy.

- Added `cascade:AIAsserted` (`owl:Class`, subClassOf `cascade:ConsumerGenerated`):
  provenance leaf for content surfaced by a general-purpose AI assistant in a
  patient-directed conversation. Safety primitive: marks `evidence:Assertion`
  inputs as ungrounded-by-construction so they are never confused with
  `cascade:AIExtracted` clinical data.
- Added `cascade:ProxyAgent` (`owl:Class`, subClassOf `prov:Agent`) and properties
  `actsForPatient`, `proxyWebID`, `proxyRelationship`, `proxyScope`,
  `proxyGrantedAt`, `proxyRevokedAt`: caregiver-proxy actor (e.g. a parent
  operating a minor child's Pod).
- SHACL: `cascade:ProxyAgentShape` (requires actsForPatient, proxyRelationship,
  proxyGrantedAt).
- Downstream sync (cascade-cli, sdk-typescript, sdk-python, cascade-agent) pending
  per the Vocabulary Change Checklist.

## v3.2 — 2026-05-06

Forward-reference closure for the Phase 4 advisory applier.

- Added `cascade:appliedTriplesCount` (`owl:DatatypeProperty`, range
  `xsd:nonNegativeInteger`, domain `cascade:AdvisoryApplicationActivity`).
  Records the number of triples a single advisory application inserted into
  the pod, enabling post-hoc auditable verification of CAP profile constraint
  C5 (≤ 64 inserted triples per match).
- The Phase 4 applier (cascade-cli `src/lib/advisory/applier.ts`) was already
  emitting this property as a documented forward reference; v3.2 retroactively
  declares it. No applier code change is needed; existing emitted records
  become SHACL-clean (Info-severity property shape encourages but does not
  require the stamp).

## v3.1 — 2026-05-05

Genomics & Advisory provenance (TASK-0.0). Two new `prov:Activity` subclasses
plus a trigger enumeration for AI generation events.

- Added `cascade:AdvisoryApplicationActivity` (`rdfs:subClassOf prov:Activity`).
  Created when a Cascade Advisory Patch is applied to a pod. Joins to
  advisory provenance via `prov:used <advisory-iri>` and
  `prov:used <matched-record-iri>`.
- Added `cascade:AIGenerationActivity` (`rdfs:subClassOf prov:Activity`).
  Sibling of `cascade:AIExtractionActivity` for LLM-generated narrative
  content (e.g., `checkup:VariantNarrative` chunks). Reuses
  `cascade:extractionModel`, `cascade:extractionConfidence`,
  `cascade:sourceNarrativeSection`, and `cascade:requiresUserReview` from
  `AIExtractionActivity`. Adds `cascade:promptVersion` and
  `cascade:generationTemperature`.
- Added `cascade:trigger` (`owl:ObjectProperty`,
  `rdfs:domain cascade:AIGenerationActivity`,
  `rdfs:range cascade:GenerationTrigger`).
- Added `cascade:GenerationTrigger` class with three named individuals:
  `cascade:InitialGeneration`, `cascade:RegenerationAfterReclassification`,
  `cascade:AudienceRetargeting`.
- Added SHACL shapes `cascade:AIGenerationActivityShape` and
  `cascade:AdvisoryApplicationActivityShape`.

Design note: a single `AIGenerationActivity` class with a `trigger` property
was chosen over multiple subclasses (e.g., a separate
`AIRegenerationActivity`). One class is enough.
